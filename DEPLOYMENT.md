1. **Connect to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository

2. **Configure settings**

   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

3. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"

## üîß Manual Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd sales_analytics_dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Upload to web server**
   - Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to your web server
   - Configure your server to serve `index.html` for all routes (SPA routing)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

**Error: Module not found**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

**Error: Port already in use**
- Kill the process using the port: `npx kill-port 3000`
- Or use a different port: `npm start -- --port 3001`

**Error: Vite not found**
- Install Vite globally: `npm install -g vite`
- Or use npx: `npx vite build`

### Deployment Issues

**Netlify: Build fails**
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
- Ensure Node.js version is set to 18
- Verify build command is `npm run build`
- Check that publish directory is `dist`

**Vercel: Build fails**
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure framework preset is set to Vite
- Verify build command and output directory

**404 errors on refresh**
- Ensure SPA routing is configured
- Check that all routes redirect to `index.html`

### Performance Issues

**Large bundle size**
- The build is already optimized with code splitting
- Charts and UI libraries are in separate chunks
- Consider lazy loading for additional optimization

**Slow loading**
- Enable gzip compression on your server
- Use a CDN for static assets
- Consider implementing service workers for caching
